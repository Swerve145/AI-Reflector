AI Reflection Helper

A Chrome extension that transforms passive AI use into active learning by prompting students to reflect on ChatGPT responses before continuing.

🎯 Overview

The AI Reflection Helper addresses a critical issue in modern education: students passively copying AI-generated answers without truly understanding them. This extension requires brief    reflections after each ChatGPT response, improving retention by up to 50% based on active learning research.

Developed as part of the Non-Trivial Fellowship 2025 research project.
